# GuessTheWordGame

Welcome to GuessTheCountry!

This program is a simple game where the user is prompted to guess the name of a randomly selected country. The user is given a certain number of attempts to guess the correct answer, and if successful, will be notified of their win.

To use GuessTheCountry, simply run the program and follow the prompts. You will be given a limited number of attempts to correctly guess the country name.

The program uses a list of countries as its data source, so there is a possibility that the same country may be selected multiple times. Additionally, the program is not case-sensitive, so you can enter country names in any combination of upper and lowercase letters.

Good luck and happy guessing!
